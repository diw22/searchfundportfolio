# searchfundportfolio
This is a summary of the software created for a search fund I worked for. It includes:
- Python-based filtering system to identify companies meeting specific criteria within a large 
(100â€™000+ entry) database. 
- SQL-integrated search interface for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
- Machine learning model for predictive assessment of company relevance using Google 
search data.
